'''Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words.
Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:'''
def reverse_word():
    myString=input('Please insert the string')
    #I will validate what happens
    print (myString.split(" "))
    myList=myString.split(" ")
    print (myList[::-1])
reverse_word()
